This algorithm performes the root finding method, bisection. 
Inputs:
  func = the function being evaluated
  x_u = the upper bound
  x_l = the lower bound
Outputs:
  root = the root of the function
  fx = the function value at your solved angle
  ea = the bisection error estimate
  iter = the number of bisection iterations
  
To use the function, the user simply needs to input the function being evaluated, and the upper and lower bounds that bracket the root they are trying to determine.
