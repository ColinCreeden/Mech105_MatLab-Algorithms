This algorithm performs Simpsons Integration
Inputs:
  x = the vector of equally spaced independent variable
  y = the vector of function values with respect to x
Outputs:
  I = the numerical integral calculated
  
To use the function, the user needs to input 2 vectors, one containing x-values, and one containing y-values that correspond to said x-values. An integration 
technique is then performed to determine the integral of the function, not by using the parent function but by simply just using values from the parent function.
