This algorithm performs LU_Factorization
Inputs:
  A = coefficient matrix
Outputs:
  L = lower triangular matrix
 	U = upper triangular matrix
  P = the permutation matrix
  
To use the function, the user simply needs to input the coefficient matrix which contains the coefficients of variables in the system of equations. The algorithm will
then output 3 matrices.
